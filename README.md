Paratext Interlinear Lexicon Interactive Browser

Uses Python 3. Open a command line and type python3 and press enter to see whether you have it. If not then go to www.python.org to download and install it.

Download this whole folder and all subfolders to your computer.

On Windows use the batch files INSTALL.bat to install prerequisites into your python3 installation.
On Linux or Mac, run
-**	python3 -m pip install lxml **
before you first run glossy.

On Windows, Mac or Linux run it from a command line (if you need options) by typing
-**	python3 glossy9.py.**

**Syntax: glossy9.py [project [output-filename [my-paratext-projects-folder]]]**

For my AHS project I type
-**	python3 glossy9.py AHS **
and it produces me a file **Lexicons/AHS_Lexicon.xhtml**

It will create files in a Lexicon folder. Open these in a web browser.
